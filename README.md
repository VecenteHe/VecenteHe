- 👋 Hi, I’m @VecenteHe
- 😭 I'm a International Relations (IR) student experiencing the death of the qualitative method
- 👀 I’m interested in theories of IR, statebuilding, post-conflict reconstruction, civil war, and spatial theory
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R and ArcGis (probably Python to allow me to survive)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on quantiative studies in IR and its theories.
- 📫 How to reach me: heyongirt@outlook.com
